# SocialConnex
This is my first guided project using MERN stack. The project is basically a social media web app on which a user can discover new people, create account, follow or unfollow another user, post content, like and comment on each other content. The authentication and authorization is handled using JSOM web tokens (JWT). 

👥 Connect with Like-Minded Souls:
Discover and connect with a diverse range of users, each with their unique passions and interests. Follow your friends, family, or people with shared hobbies, and let them follow you in return. 🤝

📸 Express Yourself through Posts:
Unleash your creativity by sharing captivating photos, videos, and status updates with the SocialConnex community. Share your experiences, ideas, and moments that matter most to you. 📸

💕 Spread Positivity with Likes and Comments:
Foster a supportive atmosphere by expressing your appreciation through likes and engaging in lively discussions through comments. Encourage one another and create a space of positivity and inspiration. 💬

👤 Customize Your Profile:
Create a captivating profile that reflects your personality, interests, and aspirations. Upload a profile picture, and add a short bio to introduce yourself to the community. ✨

Get ready to embark on a journey of discovery, inspiration, and friendship at SocialSphere. Let's make the world a better place—one connection at a time. Join us now! 🚀
